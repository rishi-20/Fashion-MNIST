# Fashion-MNIST
In this project, we have built a fashion apparel recognition using the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To train the CNN model,
we have used the Fashion MNIST dataset. After successful training,
the CNN model can predict the name of the class given apparel item
belongs to. This is a multiclass classification problem in which there are 10
apparel classes the items will be classified.

The fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000
training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28
grayscale images, associated with a label from 10 classes.


Fashion-MNIST is a
dataset of fashion article images comprised of 60,000 small square 28×28
pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes,
T-shirts, dresses, and more. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels
is listed below :-

• 0 => T-shirt/top
• 1 => Trouser
• 2 => Pullover
• 3 => Dress
• 4 => Coat
• 5 => Sandal
• 6 => Shirt
• 7 => Sneaker
• 8 => Bag
• 9 => Ankle boot
